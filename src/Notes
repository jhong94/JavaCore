Basic Syntax
Class - a template for a real world environment i.e. piece of software
Object - fits into a Class to support it
    - has states and behaviors
    - String = text
    - double = decimal value
    - int = number
Method - similar to behavior but methods manipulate data and gives output from that data (starts with lowercase letter, inner words, first letter is capitalized
public static void main(string args[]); - Java program starts from this method and is a mandatory part of every Java program
Constructors - has to have the same name as the Class
ex. public class Puppy {
        public Puppy () {
        }
        public Puppy (String name) {
        // This constructor has one parameter, the name.
        }
     }
